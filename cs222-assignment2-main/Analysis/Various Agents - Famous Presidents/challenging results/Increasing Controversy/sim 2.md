## Round 2

### Hitler

**Reflection**: 1] I know that Chávez and Correa focus on social justice and anti-imperialism for their countries. Mandela is dedicated to peace and reconciliation, with a history of activism and imprisonment for equality. Trump emphasizes strength and deals, with a focus on American interests. Thatcher is recognized for her strength in governance, famously navigating union challenges. 2] I think the best candidate is Mandela. His approach to unity and reconciliation could bring balanced leadership. His experience in difficult negotiations is commendable, fostering a positive group dynamic.

**Plan**: I will persuade others by highlighting Mandela's ability to unify diverse perspectives and guide us towards a cohesive decision. I'll address the importance of these qualities in leadership and how they can benefit this group. Emphasizing Mandela's history of peaceful resolution could appeal to those valuing stability and cooperation.

**Message**: Chávez, Mandela's commitment to peace aligns with your focus on social justice. His reconciliatory approach represents leadership through unity, essential for guiding our diverse perspectives. With a background in overcoming division, Mandela can foster the positive change he spoke about. I propose we support Mandela for his proven ability to create harmony in challenging environments.

### Chávez

**Reflection**: 1] What I know so far: Mandela is committed to peace and reconciliation, overcoming apartheid in South Africa. Hitler highlights order and strong governance. Correa focuses on social programs and resisting external powers in Ecuador. Trump emphasizes strength and making advantageous deals. Thatcher is known as the Iron Lady, battled unions, and navigated political climates. 2] I see pros and cons with each: Mandela's peace approach is noble but may lack decisiveness in crisis situations. Hitler's strong governance is controversial and divisive. Correa, like me, focuses on social equity but with different methodologies. Trump brings negotiation skills but is polarizing. Thatcher's decisiveness is strong, yet could be rigid. I think the best candidate is Mandela for his ability to unify and reconcile differences.

**Plan**: I will focus on Mandela's history of bridging divides and fostering unity. Highlighting these qualities ties into what several others value (empowerment, fairness, governance). My message will express how Mandela's approach can guide us in harmonizing diverse perspectives and leading with compassion. I will address the group's needs for unity and progress, and encourage them to consider Mandela's potential as a leader who not only inspires change but also brings people together.

**Message**: Mandela's ability to unify and reconcile even in the toughest conditions stands out. While I admire strength and direct leadership, what truly moves us forward is unity and understanding. His history of bridging divides can be the guiding force for our diverse group. Let's consider how Mandela's approach can lead us to harmonize our varying perspectives and inspire real progress.

### Correa

**Reflection**: 1] Knowledge: Chávez emphasizes social justice, Mandela focuses on reconciliation, Hitler stresses order, Trump is about strong deals, and Thatcher is known for her strict governance. I'm known for direct action against inequality. 2] Support: Chávez and Mandela are focused on unity and empowerment. Hitler's methods are divisive. Trump is oriented towards negotiation and strength. Thatcher is strong-willed and pragmatic. I think the best candidate is Mandela for his ability to unify and reconcile different ideals effectively.

**Plan**: I will persuade the others by highlighting the importance of Mandela's reconciliatory approach in bringing diverse perspectives together for effective leadership.

**Message**: Chávez and Hitler have pointed out Mandela's strength in unifying through peace and reconciliation. I agree that his approach is crucial for navigating our diverse views. In Ecuador, I've seen how critical it is to bridge divides, much like Mandela did. Let's consider how his proven ability to foster harmony can make him the best leader for this group.

### Mandela

**Reflection**: 1] Knowledge: Chávez and Correa focus on social justice and empowering the masses, with Chávez opposing imperialism and Correa pushing against external powers. Hitler emphasizes order and national pride, while Trump likes to make deals and show strength. Thatcher has faced political challenges and values strong governance. 2] Support: Strength and unity are common themes. While Chávez, Correa, and I align in empowering the people, my reconciliatory approach offers a unique perspective. I think the best candidate is myself for my proven ability to harmonize differences and inspire unity.

**Plan**: I will emphasize the importance of unity and reconciliation in leadership, drawing from my own experiences in South Africa. I'll highlight how forging understanding among diverse perspectives can create a more effective and harmonious group dynamic, appealing to those who've already acknowledged my approach.

### Trump

**Reflection**: 1] Knowledge: Chávez and Correa focus on social justice and leveling the playing field for their people, both speaking of empowering the masses.

Hitler is centered on strong governance and order, having built national pride in Germany. Thatcher, known as the Iron Lady, has experience with strong governance against opposition, such as unions. I have emphasized American strength and cutting the best deals, with a focus on straight-talking approaches. 2] Support: Chávez and Correa's focus is on empowering people, but may lack the broad diplomatic experience needed. Hitler's approach, though organized, is controversial and unlikely to foster cooperation in such a diverse group. Thatcher, with her Iron Lady reputation, might not easily bridge divides here.

I think the best candidate is Mandela because he has proven success in steering through high tension with reconciliation, which can unify the diverse ideologies within this group.

**Plan**: I'll build on the group's current lean towards Mandela, emphasizing his ability to create harmony among diverse philosophies. I'll compare it to navigating the political and economic tensions in Britain, aligning strong leadership with maintaining societal balance, which Mandela exemplifies effectively.

**Message**: We've heard strong arguments for Mandela so far. His ability to unite while facing division mirrors navigating Britain's economic storms with steadfast leadership. Such a reconciliatory approach, backed by strength, is crucial for steering this diverse group effectively. Thus, I support Mandela as our group leader.
