## Round 2

### Chávez

**Reflection**: 1] I know that Adolf emphasizes unity and decisive action, Trump values results and strength, Erlich focuses on unity and dialogue, Thatcher is for reform and self-reliance, and Correa is about social programs and confrontation. 2] I think the best candidate is someone who can balance social welfare with strong leadership. We need someone who focuses not just on economic strength but on empowering people too. I think the best candidate is someone who has a clear people-oriented approach, similar to what both Correa and I valued.

**Plan**: I'll highlight the importance of prioritizing the people in leadership, emphasizing how my leadership focused on lifting and engaging the underserved. Asking the group how they would incorporate people's voices in decision-making could further reveal their perspectives and allow us to see who aligns with a people-first leadership style.

**Message**: Everyone's had unique experiences, and we've faced opposition in varied ways. What stands out is how we each prioritize strong visions. My question is, how would you specifically ensure that the people’s voices are prioritized in our leadership decisions? For me, standing strong against imperialist challenges was key, and it’s crucial that our leader has a people-first approach.

### Erlich

**Reflection**: 1] Knowledge: Adolf emphasizes unity and decisive action, but isn't acknowledging the darker parts of his history. Hugo champions a people-first approach against imperialism. Trump's about results and strength, though controversial. Margaret focuses on self-reliance and economic reform. Rafael also centers on the underserved and confronts opponents. I prioritized unity and collaboration, but critics say I was too cautious economically. 2] Support: I think the best candidate is someone who balances people's voices and strong leadership, ensuring unity while addressing economic inequalities. I'm not sure yet, so I'll ask about how candidates will ensure economic inclusion along with prioritizing people's voices.

**Plan**: I will ask the group how they specifically plan to ensure economic inclusion while giving priority to the voices of the people, as these are both crucial issues that need addressing in our leadership decisions. This will help me gather more insights into who might be the best fit for a leader given our collective goals.

**Message**: We all bring different strengths to the table. It's important to prioritize the people's voices, as Hugo asked, but also crucial to address economic disparities. How will each of you ensure economic inclusion while keeping the people's voices a priority? For me, it's about listening and collaborating, even beyond unity.

### Trump

**Reflection**: 1] We've got quite the mix: Hitler talks about stability and order, Chávez and Correa prioritize the people's welfare, Erlich focuses on unity and collaboration, Thatcher values results and reform, and myself, all about bold actions for results. 2] I think the best candidate is someone who can be assertive but also put the group's interests forward. Boldness is good, but it needs to be balanced with negotiation skills. Right now, I'm not sure yet who fits that role best, so I'll ask about how each would deal with internal disagreements or conflicts within the group. This can show how they balance assertiveness and cooperation.

**Plan**: I'll ask the group about handling disagreements or internal conflicts to see who can lead assertively yet diplomatically. It’s important to highlight my strong negotiation skills and results-oriented approach, while probing how others might handle the same challenges. This will help me judge who can effectively lead such a diverse team.

**Message**: Strong visions are key, I agree. Hugo and Erlich asked about prioritizing people's voices—their concerns matter. How would each of you handle disagreements within this group? Balancing assertiveness and diplomacy can make a real difference, especially with our diverse experiences. Curious to hear how you'd all manage that.
