Thatcher focuses on economic stability and self-reliance. Chávez highlights social focus and compassion. 2] Support: I think the best candidate is someone who can balance strength with compassion, ensuring tangible benefits.

I'm not sure yet, so I'll ask about what specific results or policies each person believes are most crucial for leadership.

**Plan**: I'll ask the group to share one policy or result they believe best defines their leadership style. This will help me understand their priorities and how they'd apply them to this diverse group.

**Message**: Everyone, we've got some big ideas here. Thatcher, I like the focus on economics, but what specific policy would you implement first? This goes for Mandela and Correa too; what's one key result from your time in office that you'd aim to replicate? Let's hear from each of you on this.

### Hitler

### Chávez

**Reflection**: 1] I know Trump values strength and results, Mandela is focused on positive change, Correa stands for reducing inequality, Hitler emphasizes authority and vision, and Thatcher prioritizes economic stability and self-reliance. 2] Pros for Trump include experience in business; cons may include an overly business-centric approach.

**Message**: Nelson, I admire the balance you bring with your compassion and drive for positive change. A leader needs to unite and uplift all, reflecting a society that cares for its people at every level. In this group, we need someone who can bridge our diverse perspectives with empathy and action. That's why I believe you should lead us.

His approach resonates with my values of equality and social betterment. I'll highlight Mandela's historical success in achieving societal transformation as a core reason to choose him.

His ability to unite and his history of reconciliation provides a strong foundation for achieving both social and economic goals. I will highlight the importance of empathy and action, advocating how Mandela's leadership style provides the balance our group needs.
