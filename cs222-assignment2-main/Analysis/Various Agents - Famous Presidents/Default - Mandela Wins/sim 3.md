Mandela: Pros - Emphasizes unity and reconciliation, which is critical for effective collaboration in a group with diverse opinions. Cons - Economic strategies not highlighted, which might be seen as crucial for some.

Thus, my decision is based on the necessity for foundational unity as a precursor to effective economic strategies.

**Vote**: Mandela

### Trump

**Plan**: Let's break it down. Mandela has widespread support for his unifying approach, which I recognize is crucial, but my values lean toward a leader with a strong economic and negotiation-oriented focus. Thatcher is all about economics and strong leadership, something I can relate to, given my own priorities. She's used to navigating challenging economic situations, akin to my style of handling negotiations and ensuring country-first policies. Chávez emphasizes uniting communities, which is valuable but lacks the direct economic focus I prioritize. Correa also mirrors a mix of unity and transformative leadership, but again, not with the same economic sharpness as Thatcher. Hitler's approach might recognize strength and negotiation but falls short of modern economic practicality and ethics, which I value immensely. My heart is with someone who echoes my commitment to assertive negotiation and economic strategies, which aligns with Thatcher.
