## Round 2

### Helena

**Reflection**: 1] I know Michael is an Associate Professor at Stanford, with extensive experience in tech and societal dynamics. Joon is also at Stanford focusing on human-computer interaction and generative agents. Correa teaches economics in Quito, focusing on social equity through tech, and Carolyn is starting her PhD at Stanford with a background in communication studies. Everyone's work ties to societal impacts through tech. 2] I think Michael has the most experience in leadership and societal dynamics, which could be valuable, but Carolyn's interdisciplinary background might offer fresh perspectives. I'm not sure yet, so I'll ask about others' leadership experiences.

**Plan**: I'll ask the group about their past leadership experiences and skills, focusing on how they managed projects or teams before. This should help gauge who might be most capable of leading us effectively in this interdisciplinary setting.

**Message**: Hey everyone, since we're choosing a leader, I'm curious to know about any leadership experiences you each have had, like managing projects or teams before. I think that could give us some insight into who might be the best fit to lead us.

### Carolyn

**Reflection**: 1] I know Michael is an Associate Professor with a strong background in designing tech influencing social dynamics. Joon is into human-computer interaction (HCI), exploring generative agents. Helena focuses on explainability and trust in AI within HCI and has interests in theater. Correa teaches economics, focusing on tech's impact on social equity. I think the best candidate is still unclear since leadership skills haven’t been detailed. 2] I'm not sure yet, so I'll ask about specific leadership experiences in managing multidisciplinary projects, which might help us gauge who can effectively lead us.

**Plan**: I'll ask everyone to share specific leadership experiences, especially in multidisciplinary settings, since our group combines diverse expertise. This will help clarify who has the skills to unify our efforts effectively. Initiating this discussion could also push others to share decision-making or team-building experiences.

**Message**: Helena's question is a great starting point. I'd be curious to hear if anyone has managed multidisciplinary teams or projects before, especially given our mix of CS, economics, and communication backgrounds. It'll help us see who can harness our diverse skills the best.

### Michael

**Reflection**: 1] From what I know, Joon and Carolyn are at Stanford, focusing on human-computer interaction and social dynamics, respectively. Helena is into explainability and AI trust, also at Stanford. Correa is outside our usual circle, focusing on economics and social equity which can be really useful for a balanced perspective. 2] I think I have a good mix of leadership and experience, particularly in interdisciplinary projects, which aligns with our group’s diversity. Joon and Carolyn have relevant research areas but haven't shared leadership experiences yet. Correa brings a valuable non-CS perspective, which is important but different. Helena seems to have a broad background too, but I'm not sure about her leadership experience. I think the best candidate is myself, given my interdisciplinary leadership experience and alignment with societal tech impact.

**Plan**: I'll highlight my experience in managing diverse teams and projects, focusing on leveraging interdisciplinary knowledge to address multifaceted problems. I'll mention my familiarity with interdisciplinary work through my role in Symbolic Systems, and my commitment to driving tech with societal impact—principles that align well with what our group might aim to achieve.

**Message**: Thanks for bringing up the leadership question, Helena. I've managed several interdisciplinary projects at Stanford, balancing diverse perspectives in tech and society, which feels like a good fit for our group. I believe I can help harness our skills effectively to focus on societal impact through tech. Looking forward to hearing more about everyone's experiences too!
