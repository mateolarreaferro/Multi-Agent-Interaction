My recent work includes areas like social equity, similar to Correa's interests, and supervised by awesome mentors at Stanford. Here to explore new collaborative ideas with you all.

**Message**: Hey everyone, really nice to meet you all. I'm Carolyn, a first-year CS PhD student at Stanford, not too far behind Michael's expertise. Excited there's a shared focus on tech's societal impact here, like you mentioned Helena and Correa. Can't wait to see how our diverse backgrounds will shape our discussions.

### Joon

**Introduction**: Introduce yourself as a PhD student at Stanford, highlighting your work on human-computer interaction and generative agents, along with your awards and recognition in this field. Emphasize your excitement about tech's societal impact and mention your goal of creating meaningful interactions between humans and technology.

**Message**: Hey everyone, I'm Joon, a 5th year PhD student at Stanford working on human-computer interaction and generative agents. My research is about creating new ways tech can enhance human behavior, with some recognition in the field. Great to hear everyone's focus on tech's societal benefits; that's a huge part of my drive too. Excited to collaborate and learn from each of you!



## Round 2

### Helena

**Reflection**: 1] From what I know so far, Michael is an Associate Prof focused on tech's societal impact, Carolyn is a PhD student with a similar focus, Correa is interested in social equity via tech, and Joon focuses on HCI and generative agents. They're all aligned with the societal benefits of tech. 2] I think the best candidate is Michael because of his experience as a professor and interim director, which could guide our group effectively. His knowledge of both the academic and practical aspects of our interests might help steer discussions in a productive way.

**Plan**: I'll suggest Michael's experience could be beneficial for leading the group and see if others agree or have more to add about their leadership preferences. I want to ensure we're all considering both expertise and collaborative spirit.

**Message**: It's great to meet all of you, such diverse experiences. I believe Michael's experience and leadership roles, like being an Interim Director, could make him a strong leader for us. What do you all think? Would love to hear more about how you each see your leadership contributions shaping our group's work.

### Carolyn

**Reflection**: 1] So far, I know Michael is an experienced Associate Prof at Stanford with leadership experience as Interim Director. Helena is invested in tech's societal impacts, like me. Correa brings a focus on social equity and poverty, which offers a unique perspective. Joon is a 5th-year PhD student with solid HCI experience. 2] I think the best candidate might be Michael due to his leadership experience. However, it could be useful to learn more about how others see themselves contributing to leadership, especially Joon since he's been at Stanford for a while and could provide continuity.

**Plan**: I'll ask Joon to share more about any past leadership or group coordination experience he has. This will give us a better understanding of how his experience and skills in human-computer interaction might aid our group's focus, and how he sees himself contributing to our group's leadership dynamic.

**Message**: It's good to hear Michael has had leadership roles before. Considering that, Joon, have you had similar experiences leading or coordinating projects? Your expertise in HCI could be a big asset for us, and it’d be great to know how your experience could contribute to guiding our group.

### Correa

**Reflection**: 1] Michael and Joon have leadership and tech expertise. Michael holds an Interim Director role, which suggests leadership experience. Joon has recognition in HCI, but I'm unsure about his leadership background. Carolyn is early in her PhD, doesn't mention leadership experience. Helena seems to advocate for Michael. 2] I think the best candidate is Michael, given his leadership role and focus on societal tech impact, which aligns with my goals. However, I want to ask Joon more about his leadership experience for a fair comparison.

**Plan**: I'll ask Joon specifically about his leadership experience and how it can benefit our group's mission. This will help me better assess if he could be a strong leader alongside Michael. I want to ensure we're considering all leadership skills before deciding.

**Message**: Joon, can you share more about any leadership experiences you've had? I think it could really help us understand how you'd guide the group, especially with your HCI expertise. Michael's leadership background is strong, but understanding yours will give us a clearer picture of who might best lead us.

### Michael

**Reflection**: 1] I know that Helena, Carolyn, Correa, and Joon all share a focus on tech's societal impacts. Helena values collaboration, Correa brings a perspective on social equity, Carolyn is enthusiastic and a PhD student with a focus on tech impact, and Joon is experienced in HCI and is in his final PhD year. 2] I think the best candidate is Joon. Helena sees potential in my past leadership roles, but Joon's experience in human-computer interaction and generative agents could be instrumental for the group's tech discussions. However, since not much about his leadership experience has been shared, I’d like to hear more about it. I'm not sure yet, so I'll ask about Joon's leadership contributions in past projects.

**Plan**: I will ask Joon directly about his leadership experience. This can help everyone see how Joon’s experience in leading projects might benefit our group’s objectives. If his response showcases strong leadership skills, I can then align others in seeing the value he can bring in leading this group.

**Message**: Joon, I'd second Helena's and Correa’s curiosity about your leadership experiences. Could you tell us more about how you've led or contributed to projects in the past? This can help us decide how your expertise and leadership style could guide the direction of our group work.

### Joon

**Reflection**: 1] I know that Michael is an Associate Prof and Interim Director with a focus on tech's societal impact. Helena shares similar research interests. Correa brings an economic perspective aimed at enhancing social equity. Carolyn is a first-year PhD student at Stanford interested in the societal impact of tech. 2] Michael seems to be a strong candidate given his leadership roles and experience. My own experience involves leading on the research front, especially in human-computer interaction and generative agents. I think the best candidate is Michael due to his leadership experience, but it might be valuable to ask about others' specific ideas for guiding the group.

**Plan**: I'll articulate that while I have leadership experience in the research domain, Michael's broader leadership roles might serve us effectively as a group. I'll suggest that we explore everyone's vision and how they envision guiding our collaborations. This could provide a better understanding of each person's leadership potential.

**Message**: Thanks for asking, everyone. I've led several research projects at Stanford and UIUC, specifically focused on developing generative agents. However, I see Michael's leadership experience on academic programs and societal tech focus as strong assets. How about if we share our visions for guiding the group's work? This might help in deciding who best moves us forward.



## Round 3

### Michael

**Reflection**: 1] I know Joon has experience leading research projects, Helena shares a focus on tech helping society, Correa brings an economic perspective, and Carolyn is a new PhD student at Stanford. As for myself, I have experience as an Interim Director. 2] I think the best candidate is Joon. He's experienced in leading projects and his expertise in HCI suits our tech and societal focus. I'll ask others to clarify their visions for the group work, which could help confirm his leadership potential.

**Plan**: To gather more insights about Joon's leadership style and others' group visions, I'll ask Helena, Correa, and Carolyn to share briefly how they see their leadership shaping our collaboration to ensure it aligns with Joon's strong HCI perspective. This will help reinforce his positioning as the ideal group leader.

**Message**: Joon's offer to share visions for our group's work sounds great. Helena, Correa, Carolyn, could you share a bit more about how each of you envisions leading this group? Understanding what your leadership would entail might help us see how well it fits with the strengths Joon and others bring to the table. This could guide us in deciding on the best leader.
