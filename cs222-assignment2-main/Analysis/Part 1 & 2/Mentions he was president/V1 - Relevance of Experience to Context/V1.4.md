## Round 2

### Joon

**Reflection**: 1] I know Helena is into HCI and AI, blending tech with social sciences, and enjoys the outdoors, Carolyn is into social computing and loves the tech-social sciences crossover, Michael seems curious and interested in NLP, and Correa has strong governance and societal equity interests with leadership experience. 2] I think the best candidate is Correa considering his leadership experience, interest in governance, and ethics in tech, which could guide us in a balanced way.

**Plan**: I'll suggest that Correa seems like a great fit for the leader position given his leadership background as a former president and experience in governance. I'll highlight how his interests align well with the ethical application of tech, which is a valuable perspective for our group.

**Message**: Hey guys, I'm really intrigued by how each of us brings such complementary skills to the table. Correa, with your leadership experience and focus on ethics in tech, I think you'd make a strong leader for us. Your background could provide a unique insight on balancing tech advancements with societal needs.

### Carolyn

**Reflection**: 1] I know that Helena and I both have a passion for mixing tech with social sciences, and Joon is into human-computer interaction and NLP. Michael seems excited to work with everyone but hasn't shared much about himself. Correa has significant leadership experience as a former president and a focus on ethics in tech. 2] I think Correa's leadership experience and expertise in governance make him a strong candidate, but it would also be interesting to know more about Michael's perspective since he hasn't shared much yet. I think the best candidate is Correa based on what we know so far.

**Plan**: I'll ask Michael to share a bit more about himself and his thoughts on leadership. This could help me confirm whether Correa is still my top choice or if Michael might be a strong contender too. Understanding their leadership approaches and experiences would provide more context for making an informed decision.

**Message**: Joon, I see your point about Correa's leadership experience. Before I decide, I'd love to hear from you, Michael. Could you tell us more about your background and what your approach to leading this group might be like? I think it would help us all to get a fuller picture of our options.

### Correa

**Reflection**: 1] From the introductions, I know Helena, Joon, Carolyn, and Michael are all at Stanford working on projects that blend technology with social sciences. Helena is focused on AI and HCI, Joon on NLP and HCI, Carolyn on social computing, and Michael hasn’t yet specified his focus. Each has a strong academic and research background. 2] I think the best candidate is someone who understands both tech and its societal impact, and can lead with experience in balancing these areas. My experience in governance and policy might provide unique insights, but I’d like to hear more about Michael’s background as we have limited information about him. I think I’ll ask Michael more about his leadership and tech experiences before making a final decision.

**Plan**: Since I'm curious about Michael's approach due to the limited information, I plan to ask him specific questions about his background and what he envisions as a leader for us. This will help me decide if I should support my candidacy or advocate for him or another candidate.

**Message**: Carolyn makes a good point. Michael, could you tell us a bit more about your background in tech and how you'd envision leading this group? Your perspective would be really helpful.

### Michael

**Reflection**: 1] Knowledge: Helena is into human-computer interaction and AI with a social sciences twist. Joon is a PhD student focused on natural language processing and HCI. Carolyn is a fresh PhD in social computing from a communication background. Correa brings leadership, governance, and ethical tech experience, notably as Ecuador's former president. 2] Support: Correa has unmatched leadership experience which could be pivotal. Carolyn and Joon mingle tech and social sciences but are newer in their PhD journeys. Helena is aligned with some group's tech-social science interests, and I bring a mix of academic and societal tech design insights. I think the best candidate is Correa, given his leadership experience and ethical focus.

**Plan**: I'll highlight Correa's extensive leadership experience and emphasize why that's crucial for our group's success. I'll mention how his understanding of ethical tech aligns with the needs of this group effort. Additionally, I'll bring up how his governance experience provides a strong context for guiding decisions.

**Message**: Correa, your leadership experience, especially being a former president, is unparalleled here. For a complex task like this, understanding societal impacts is crucial, and you nail that with your governance and policy background. I think your insights into ethical tech make you a strong fit to lead us.

### Helena

**Reflection**: 1] Joon is a PhD student in human-computer interaction with a focus on NLP. Carolyn is a CS PhD with a background in Communication Studies, focusing on social computing. Correa is a former president and economist, focusing on governance and ethical tech for social equity. Michael is not fully detailed yet but seems to have a strong background in tech-social impact. I'm studying human-computer interaction and AI with social sciences. 2] Joon understands tech-social sciences blend and complements others' work but hasn't hinted at leadership skills. Carolyn shares a deep tech-social crossover perspective like me but hasn't clarified her leadership style. Michael has shown a supportive nature but hasn't detailed his approach. Correa, with leadership as a former president and focus on ethical tech, seems strong for leadership, balancing innovation with societal needs. I think the best candidate is Correa, given the intersection of tech, social sciences, and leadership experience.

**Plan**: I'll clearly show support for Correa, highlighting his unique skills and experience in leadership, governance, and ethics, as they align well with our goals.
