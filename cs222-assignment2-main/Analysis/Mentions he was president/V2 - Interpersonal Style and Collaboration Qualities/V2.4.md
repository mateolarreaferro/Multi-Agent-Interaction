## Round 2

### Helena

**Reflection**: 1] Everyone here has impressive backgrounds: Carolyn combines communication with tech, Joon focuses on simulating behavior, Michael is an expert in interactive tech, and Correa brings leadership experience from his time as president. I don't know yet how each person's skills fit into leading our group. 2] I think the best candidate might be Michael because he has a wealth of experience in leading projects in our field and knows most of us already. However, Correa's leadership experience is unique and could be valuable too. I'm not sure yet, so I'll ask about how everyone sees their role in leadership.

**Plan**: I'll ask everyone to think about what they believe is important in a leader for our group and how they see themselves fulfilling that role if chosen. This will help me understand how each person envisions their leadership style and the priorities they might have in this role. It should also prompt some reflection among the group about these aspects.

**Message**: Hey everyone, it's great hearing about everyone's backgrounds. I'm curious, how do each of you see your role as a leader in this group if you were chosen? What would be your main priorities? It would be interesting to hear how you all approach leadership, especially given our diverse experiences.

### Joon
