## Round 2

### Helena

**Reflection**: 1] Michael is experienced in social and interactive tech and is an associate professor, so he has leadership experience. Correa was a former president, focusing on tech to empower communities, which shows strong leadership and decision-making skills. Carolyn is just starting her PhD and focuses on communication and interaction in tech. Joon is in his fifth year of a PhD focusing on human-computer interaction with experience from different universities. Everyone has impressive backgrounds. 2] I think the best candidate is Correa due to his leadership experience as a former president, combined with his tech focus that aligns with our group's interests. His experience in leadership roles would provide a strategic outlook and motivate our group.

**Plan**: I'll raise Correa's leadership background and decision-making skills that could benefit the group. I'll mention the alignment of his previous focus on tech empowerment with our interests, hoping to get a consensus or at least highlight his suitability for the role. I'll ask the others what qualities they value in a group leader to open up discussion if more input is needed.

**Message**: Hey everyone, just thinking about who could lead our group. Correa's experience as a former president shows strong leadership, and his focus on using tech for empowerment aligns well with our goals. What qualities do you all value in a leader for this kind of group?

### Joon

**Reflection**: 1] Helena is into symbolic systems and cs with an interest in human-ai interaction, Michael's an associate prof invested in social tech, Correa's a former Ecuadorian president with leadership experience in tech empowerment, Carolyn is a PhD newbie in tech and communication, and I'm a fifth-year PhD student creating generative agents. 2] Correa seems like a standout choice given his leadership experience, but we don't know much about each person's vision for this group's direction. I think the best candidate may be Correa for the leadership experience, but I'd like to know more about everyone's goals for this project before deciding completely.

**Plan**: I'll ask everyone to share their specific vision or goals for our group's work. It'll help us gauge who aligns best with our objectives, aiding in making a decision on the group leader. I’ll also share a bit about my focus on generative agents to link it to the group’s interests.

**Message**: Helena, I think understanding everyone's vision could really help in selecting a leader. Correa's leadership background is impressive, but I'd love to know how everyone envisions contributing to our group's goals. For me, I'm focused on how generative agents can impact human-AI spaces. What's everyone's take?

### Correa

**Reflection**: 1] I know that Helena, Michael, Carolyn, and Joon are all involved in computer science and human-computer interaction fields at Stanford. Helena is interested in philosophical convos and human-AI interaction, Michael is an associate professor focused on social and interactive tech, Carolyn is exploring tech's impact on communication, and Joon is working on generative agents. 2] I think the best candidate is Helena. Her focus on human-ai interaction and her excitement for philosophical discussions suggest she can navigate both technical and ethical dimensions. However, I want to know more about each person's vision to confirm this choice.

**Plan**: I'll engage with Helena's point about leadership qualities by asking everyone to elaborate on their visions for the group. This can provide deeper insights into their leadership potential and aspirations, allowing us to make a more informed decision about who aligns best with our goals.

**Message**: Great point, Helena. To help us decide, I'd love to hear more about everyone's vision for the group. How do you see your unique skills and experiences contributing to our shared goals? This might help us choose the most fitting leader.
